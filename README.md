# fantasy-defense-decompiled
 Decompiled code for a 2011 game no one ever knows about, with some tweaks to make it more manageable. Not affiliated with SN Mobile Technology

Note: This code builds, but nothing is tested

PROGRESS:
All pages done
StagePage code still WIP and terrible but everything else has to be tested first

All achievements done

Other TODO:
- Static variables for resource array locations for more mod-ability
- Removing ID-Style resource gathering for a decompiled one
- PC Port
