# fantasy-defense-decompiled
 Decompiled code for a 2011 game no one ever knows about, with some tweaks to make it more manageable. Not affiliated with SN Mobile Technology

Crashes on startup due to resources.arsc being broken

PROGRESS:
All pages done
StagePage code still WIP and terrible but everything else has to be tested first

All achievements done

Other TODO:
- Static variables for resource array locations for more mod-ability
- Finishing and recompiling resources.arsc modification
- PC Port
