# fantasy-defense-decompiled
 Decompiled code for a 2011 game no one ever knows about, with some tweaks to make it more manageable. Not affiliated with SN Mobile Technology

Note: This code doesn't build smoothly due to compilation issues and WIP restructuring

PROGRESS:
All pages except StagePage done
StagePage - 555 errors

All achievements done

Other TODO:
- Fix Draw on units, specially ObjectUnit class
- Fix Special skills on Hero Unit
- Restructure type to merely identifying the class used instead of being [(class * 3) + lv]
- Static variables for resource array locations for more mod-ability
- Removing ID-Style resource gathering for a decompiled one
- PC Port
- Get rid of the androidx folder entirely
