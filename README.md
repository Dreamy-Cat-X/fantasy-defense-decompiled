# fantasy-defense-decompiled
 Decompiled code for a 2011 game no one ever knows about, with some tweaks to make it more manageable. Not affiliated with SN Mobile Technology
- Everything runs as it should. Decensored designs mode & file selection menu were also things I took the luxury to add that weren't present in the original game

## Other TODO
- PC Port
- Move all display strings to strings.xml
- Bitmask-ify effect type, to allow an unit to have multiple effects (for modding)
