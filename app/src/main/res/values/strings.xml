    <string name="intro0">Humans and monsters used to coexist _ on the Crasto Continent,</string>
    <string name="intro1">and its history was determined by</string>
    <string name="intro2">its founding heroes who fought</string>
    <string name="intro3">against the Wraith King _ who wished to annihilate the Humans.</string>
    <string name="intro4">Thousands of years ago,</string>
    <string name="intro5">the Humans started a war _ against the monsters</string>
    <string name="intro6">that were born to prey upon men.</string>
    <string name="intro7">For hundreds of years,</string>
    <string name="intro8">thousands of Humans died</string>
    <string name="intro9">until heroes rose up to seal the Wraith King,_ the father of all monsters.</string>
    <string name="intro10">He was sealed at the end of the world</string>
    <string name="intro11">and his children were weakened.</string>
    <string name="intro12">While the Humans enjoyed their victory,</string>
    <string name="intro13">the surviving monsters fled to the _ end of the continent.</string>
    <string name="intro14">And thenâ€¦</string>
    <string name="intro15">It was a new era of peace.</string>
    <string name="intro16">The signs of war\'s ravage slowly vanished.</string>
    <string name="intro17">The soil was rich</string>
    <string name="intro18">and the forests grew far and wide.</string>
    <string name="intro19">The Humans forgot</string>
    <string name="intro20">one important truth:</string>
    <string name="intro21">the evil king might be sealed,</string>
    <string name="intro22">but he wasn\'t destroyed.</string>
    <string name="intro23">One day, a volcano erupted without warning</string>
    <string name="intro24">and spewed flaming red lava for a week.</string>
    <string name="intro25">The sun didn\'t rise.</string>
    <string name="intro26">The moon and stars hid themselves.</string>
    <string name="intro27">It was a week when</string>
    <string name="intro28">the sky was always pitch-dark.</string>
    <string name="intro29">No light could be seen, day or night.</string>
    <string name="intro30">One night, an evil moon appeared.</string>
    <string name="intro31">It was an omen declaring the evil king\'s coming.</string>
    <string name="intro32">On the seventh night of the evil moon,</string>
    <string name="intro33">the seal of the evil king completely lost its power,</string>
    <string name="intro34">allowing the king resurrect</string>
    <string name="intro35">at the end of the world.</string>
    <string name="intro36">Wraith King is now on the loose, stronger than ever, _ and ready to strike back.</string>
    <string name="end0">The heroes resealed Wraith King,</string>
    <string name="end1">finally bringing an end to the war.</string>
    <string name="end2">Peace returned to the Crasto Continent.</string>
    <string name="end3">The people shouted for joy,</string>
    <string name="end4">and the soldiers came back home safely.</string>
    <string name="end5">Everyone thought that the</string>
    <string name="end6">Crasto Continent would be prosperous again,</string>
    <string name="end7">but</string>
    <string name="end8">they weren\'t aware of another disaster _ looming on the horizon.</string>
    <string name="end9">Perhaps they preferred ignorant bliss after being ravaged _ by the horrendous war for a long time.</string>
    <string name="end10">..</string>
    <string name="end11">How did the Wraith King break out of his seal?</string>
    <string name="end12">He returned to punish all the Humans on earth.</string>
    <string name="end13">His seal wasn\'t supposed to</string>
    <string name="end14">break so easily.</string>
